# Fix for Bookings Page Loading Issue

## Problem
The bookings page doesn't load when the backend server is running because there are bookings in the database with `service_id: 10` and `staff_id: 11` that don't exist in the services/staff tables. This causes repeated database lookups and console spam.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Optimization (✅ Already Applied)
I've optimized the backend to:
- **Cache lookups**: Service and staff lookups are now cached to avoid repeated database queries
- **Track missing IDs**: Once an ID is determined to be missing, it won't be looked up again
- **Clean logging**: Missing IDs are logged only once as a warning instead of flooding the console

### 2. Diagnostic Tools (✅ Created)
Two new scripts have been added to help you understand and fix the database:

#### Check Database Script
```bash
npm run db:check
```
This will show you:
- All bookings in your database
- Available services and staff
- Which bookings have orphaned references (invalid service_id or staff_id)

#### Fix Orphaned Bookings Script
```bash
npm run db:fix
```
This will:
- Find all bookings with invalid service_id or staff_id
- Prompt you to fix them by setting those fields to NULL
- This prevents errors while keeping the booking data intact

## How to Fix Your Issue

### Option 1: Clean Up Database (Recommended)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\GitHub\SBS\Combined Frontend\Combined Frontend\backend"

# First, check what's wrong
npm run db:check

# Then fix the orphaned bookings
npm run db:fix
```

This will set invalid service_id and staff_id to NULL, which the frontend handles gracefully.

### Option 2: Add Missing Services and Staff
If you want to keep the service_id: 10 and staff_id: 11 references:

1. Add a service with ID 10 to your database
2. Add a staff member with ID 11 to your database

You can do this through the Content Manager in the Merchant Portal, or by running SQL:

```sql
-- Add missing service (run in salon.db or merchant.db)
INSERT INTO services (id, name, description, duration_min, price) 
VALUES (10, 'Sample Service', 'Service description', 60, 50);

-- Add missing staff (run in salon.db or merchant.db)
INSERT INTO staff (id, name, bio, specialties) 
VALUES (11, 'Staff Member', 'Bio here', '[]');
```

### Option 3: Delete Orphaned Bookings
If these are test bookings you don't need:

```sql
-- Connect to salon.db and run:
DELETE FROM bookings WHERE service_id = 10 OR staff_id = 11;
```

## After Fixing

1. Restart your backend server
2. The console should now show at most:
   ```
   ⚠️  Missing services: 10
   ⚠️  Missing staff: 11
   ```
   (Only once, if you didn't fix the data)

3. The bookings page should load properly
4. Bookings without service/staff names will show "N/A" or "Booking #[id]"

## Prevention

Going forward, when creating bookings:
1. Always use existing service_id and staff_id values
2. Use the Content Manager to add services and staff first
3. Run `npm run db:check` periodically to catch issues early

## Technical Details

The optimizations made:
- Added `Map` caches for services, staff, and customers
- Added `Set` to track missing IDs (prevents repeated failed lookups)
- Reduced console logging from per-booking to once per request
- Response time improved from potentially several seconds to milliseconds

The caches are maintained in memory for the lifetime of the server process, which significantly speeds up the `/api/bookings` endpoint.
